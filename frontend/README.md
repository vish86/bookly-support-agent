This is the **Bookly Support Console** frontend, a single-page Next.js app styled in the spirit of [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Getting Started

The UI assumes the FastAPI backend is running locally on `http://localhost:8000` (see the root `README.md` and `backend/README.md`).

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to use the console UI.

The main chat experience lives in `src/app/page.tsx`.
